  "raw": "To address dark+noise in the image, when conducting first denoising and then brightening, the fail rates of addressing ['dark', 'noise'] are ['30%', '32%'] respectively, and the total fail rate is 31%; when conducting first brightening and then denoising, the fail rates of addressing ['dark', 'noise'] are ['43%', '33%'] respectively, and the total fail rate is 38%.",
  "distilled": "From the data you've provided, we can derive some valuable insights regarding the order of operations in image restoration, particularly when dealing with multiple degradations. Here's a distilled analysis based on your findings:\n\n1. **Impact of Task Order on Performance:**\n   - **Denoising before Brightening:** When denoising is performed before brightening, the fail rates for addressing dark and noise are 30% and 32% respectively, with a total fail rate of 31%.\n   - **Brightening before Denoising:** Conversely, when brightening is performed first, followed by denoising, the fail rates increase to 43% for dark and 33% for noise, with a total fail rate of 38%.\n\n2. **Interpretation and Strategy:**\n   - **Lower Fail Rates with Denoising First:** The data suggests that performing denoising before brightening results in lower fail rates for both individual degradations and overall. This indicates that denoising first might be more effective in preserving details and reducing noise, which could otherwise be amplified by the subsequent brightening process.\n   - **Potential Reasons:** Brightening an image can increase the visibility of noise, making it harder to clean effectively afterward. Denoising first reduces the noise level, ensuring that the subsequent brightening enhances brightness without exacerbating noise artifacts.\n\n3. **Generalized Approach for Multiple Degradations:**\n   - **Address Noise and Artifacts First:** Based on the observed pattern, it might be generally advisable to address noise and other similar artifacts (like jpeg compression artifacts) before applying transformations that alter the image's brightness or contrast (like brightening or dehazing).\n   - **Consider the Nature of Degradations:** For other types of degradations like blur (motion or defocus), the order might depend on the specific characteristics of the blur and its interaction with noise. Typically, deblurring might be more effective when the image is relatively noise-free, suggesting a potential preference for denoising before deblurring if both degradations are present.\n\n4. **Experimental Validation for Complex Cases:**\n   - **Test Different Orders:** For images with multiple or complex degradations, it's beneficial to experiment with different orders of restoration tasks to empirically determine the most effective sequence.\n   - **Develop a Guideline:** Based on accumulated experiences and systematic testing, develop a guideline or decision tree that helps in deciding the order based on the types and severity of degradations observed in the image.\n\nIn summary, the key takeaway from your data is that the order of restoration tasks significantly affects the outcome, and generally, it might be more effective to remove noise before enhancing brightness. This principle could potentially extend to other similar tasks, where preprocessing to remove or reduce artifacts before applying enhancement or correction tasks could yield better restoration results."
